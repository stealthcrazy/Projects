BattleShips - A graphical terminal implementation of the Battleship board game against a computer
Evolution of Life -  A fun implementation of Conways game of life and includes an editor to create cellular automaton
Frequency Amplitude Modeling using FFT - Converting sine waves into frequency and amplitude graphs using Fourier transforms
Image Compression using FFT - A cool Image lossy image compression algorithm that uses Fast Fourier Transforms to reduce image file sizes , and uncompress them after transfered through a network
SHA - An implementation of SHA256 Hashing which is used in real world scenarios on the Blockchain
SHA3 - An Implementation of SHA3 standarisation by NIST , includes XOF functions
Square Wave Modeling - Modeling Square Waves ing Pygame using Fourier Series
TETRIS - A fun and cool custom twist on the classic Tetris game , includes infinte level and built in terminal. The game has a menu and music built into the terminal
TerminalGameEngine - A fun infinte Runner inspired by the "google dino game" designed in the terminal/
